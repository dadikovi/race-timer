# race-timer

This is a work-in-progress hobby project which aims to create a basic race timer system using `Go` and `Flutter`.

This race timer system is created especially for that use-case when the participants of the race cannot start together in the same time, so their race times must be measured individually and compared later. A more detailed description of this use case is available [here](docs/images/race-timer-usecase.png)

## Features

- Easy finish time registration using QR scanner client
- Realtime time table is available on a public website
